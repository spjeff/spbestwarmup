## Description
Tired of waiting for SharePoint pages to load? Want something easy to support? That works on all versions? This warmup script is for you!

I used several different warmup scripts. All worked OK but each seemed to lack features so I decided to create a new one. Hope you find it useful too.

## Prerequisites
* PowerShell 3.0+

  PowerShell 5.1 can be installed on Server 2008R2: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/5.1/install-configure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/5.1/install-configure)

## Quick Start
* Download `SPBestWarmup.ps1`
* Copy `SPBestWarmup.ps1` to one SharePoint web front end (WFE)
* Run `SPBestWarmup.ps1 -f` to install farm wide. Creates Task Scheduler job on every machine.
* Run `SPBestWarmup.ps1 -i` to install locally. Creates Task Scheduler job on the local machine.
* Run `SPBestWarmup.ps1 -u` to uninstall farm wide. Deletes any Task Scheduler job named "SPBestWarmup"
* Sit back and enjoy!

## Admin Tip
* After reboot run this command to manually trigger the job and warm up IIS
`SCHTASKS /RUN /TN "SPBestWarmup"`

## Custom URLs
* Use the `-url` paramter to add custom URLs from the command line. 
* Rename Central Admin site title and edit lines `331-345` to add custom URLs within the script.  Good for lifecycle (dev, test, prod).

## Permission
* Running this with a different service account than farm might require you to first grant PowerShell access. This ensures the service account has access to run `Get-SPWebApplication` and `Get-SPServer` for detecting URLs to load. [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg490648.aspx
